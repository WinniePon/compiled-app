Our team is currently designing a mobile application named UpToDate. UpToDate in essence, is a calendar app designed for schools to help parents as well as students themselves to be aware of upcoming school events, assignment deadlines, and holidays. The app provides a calendar, schedule, photo sharing function, absence reporting function, AI chat assistant, and bug reporting system.

¬†Overview UpToDate
UpToDate is a mobile application for Android devices. To log into the app, users must enter their email and password. Once in the app, users can view upcoming upcoming school events, assignment deadlines, and holidays in the calendar and Upcoming Events Bar. The Menu Bar contains Community, AI Counsellor, Absence Request, Schedule, Contact Us, and Log Out. FBLA UpToDate is currently error free, and the team also implemented a bug reporting system for users to notify our team on bugs.

How To Run
This app was developed...
Committing¬†and¬†pushing¬†are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub. That way your instructor and/or teammates can see your latest work when you‚Äôre ready to share it. You can make a commit when you have made changes to your project that you want to ‚Äúcheckpoint.‚Äù You can also add a helpful¬†commit message¬†to remind yourself or your teammates what work you did (e.g. ‚ÄúAdded a README with information about our project‚Äù).
Once you have a commit or multiple commits that you‚Äôre ready to add to your repository, you can use the push command to add those changes to your remote repository. Committing and pushing may feel new at first, but we promise you‚Äôll get used to it¬†üôÇ

The Team's mission
Our mission at UpToDate is to help students and parents keep track of important events, academic progress, and improve student time management skills. Our three key values are time management, punctuality, and academic growth. UpToDate aims to expand its use to the entire student body at SHSID and also adapt to teachers‚Äô usage.

The Team's Brand/Logo
Our brand name UpToDate reflects our mission statement and values and is also closely related with our logo. The calendar embodies punctuality; the squares that pop up are notifications on upcoming events. The checkmark represents time management and completion of tasks acting as a predominant affirmative symbol of convenience and awareness.

Your user profile
Your profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you're interested in, the contributions you've made, and the conversations you've had. You can also give the world a unique view into who you are with your profile README. You can use your profile to let future employers know all about you! To learn more about your user profile and adding and updating your profile README, read¬†"Managing Your Profile README".

Using markdown on GitHub
You might have noticed already, but you can add some fun styling to your issues, pull requests, and files.¬†"Markdown"¬†is an easy way to style your issues, pull requests, and files with some simple syntax. This can be helpful to organize your information and make it easier for others to read. You can also drop in gifs and images to help convey your point! To learn more about using GitHub‚Äôs flavor of markdown, read¬†"Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax".

How To Access/Contributes: (detailed)
The GitHub community is vast. There are many types of people who use GitHub in their day to day‚Äîstudents like you, professional developers, hobbyists working on open source projects, and explorers who are just jumping into the world of software development on their own. There are many ways you can interact with the larger GitHub community, but here are three places where you can start.

Login Page
The login page is basic and has all the essential components of a traditional login. First time users may use the Sign Up option to register their own UpToDate account by verifying an email address and setting up a private password. Users who already have an established account need only to enter their email address and password to Sign In. After users successfully Sign In to their accounts, users can customize their names by tapping into the profile icon located at the top right corner. Users can select pictures from their photo gallery as their profile picture.

Home Page
The Home Page includes a calendar, the Upcoming Events bar, as well as the Menu Bar. The calendar displays the current date and users can select different dates. The Upcoming Events bar chronologically organizes upcoming events, assignment deadlines, holidays, and exams in order of urgency. The Menu Bar, located on the top left corner, displays UpToDate‚Äôs 5 main functions as well as the Log Out option.

Schedule
The Schedule contains the daily timetable for each student. Students or parents can check their next courses here. The Schedule has a Scrollbar with numbers ranging from 1 to 5, where users may select which school day‚Äôs timetable they want to view. The timetable is organized into two columns: the course names and corresponding time periods.

Community (social media)
Community is UpToDate‚Äôs social media platform where users may post logs or pictures about school events. The Write Post option will bring users to a separate page, where users may customize their own drafts to post. Users can view each other‚Äôs posts and scroll to refresh and see more posts.

Absence Request
Absence Request allows parents or students themselves to file leaves when students cannot attend school. First, users would select the specific date they would be absent on using the Day and Month Scrollbars. If the student would be absent for a span of days, multiple Absence Requests would have to be filed. In the text box, users need to enter the reason for their absence. Pressing Apply would confirm and terminate the Absence Request.

AI Counsellor
AI Counsellor is an AI chat assistant dedicated to providing research on colleges for high school students. Users have to enter the name of a university they‚Äôre interested in and come up with a question they have about that school. The Counsellor would then generate a response to the question. The refresh button will return users to the initial page. With Counsellor, UpToDate hopes to prepare high school students early on for college applications and emphasize punctuality.

Contact US Page
The Contact Us page contains two functions. The first is a bug reporting system that allows users to report errors via text or screenshots. The reports would be forwarded to our team‚Äôs emails, where we will ensure the changes are fixed asap. The latter half of the page contains our team‚Äôs contact information on WeChat and Twitter.
